&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jacobschellenberg/MultiplesOf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;View on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, if you know a clean way to convert &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GetSumOfMultiplesOf&lt;/code&gt; into a more functional… function, I’d appreciate the pro tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also couldn’t think of a better name for the variables &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_multipleOf01&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_multipleOf02&lt;/code&gt;. It’s might be slightly confusing that you are getting the multiple of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;02&lt;/code&gt;, but the name is supposed to represent the input, of which there are 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently I wrote the initial version of this back in November 2013. Nearly 5 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at it, I was pretty happy with the result. When I wrote this, I would have been a fresh graduate from college, only a few months out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to upload this one first because, well, I’m just going through all my projects in alphabetical order, cleaning them up, and uploading them here for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to note that this is my current coding style. I’m sure I’ll end up doing a post purely about coding style/standards. I’ve spent a lot of time pondering, studying, and devising coding styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this tiny bit of code is a good representation of my own personal, clean coding standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I’m not too happy about here is the function &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GetSumOfMultiplesOf&lt;/code&gt; because of the mutation of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; variable. Otherwise, the non-mutation of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sumOfMultiples&lt;/code&gt; is pretty darn neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really trying to be more functional in my programming. It’s getting there!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="[&quot;blog&quot;, &quot;challenge&quot;]" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Unity Tools Engineer at E-Line Media</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/resume/blog/2018/08/10/unity-tools-engineer-at-e-line-media.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unity Tools Engineer at E-Line Media" /><published>2018-08-10T07:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-08-10T07:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/resume/blog/2018/08/10/unity-tools-engineer-at-e-line-media</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/resume/blog/2018/08/10/unity-tools-engineer-at-e-line-media.html">&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;initialize&quot;&gt;Initialize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that stinks about a project failing, is that there is a pretty good chance you’ll have nothing to show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At PING, we worked hard for 11 months, and then one day we were ushered out, never to hear about our game again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PING was my first gig right out of college. In fact, I technically had the job two weeks before I graduated, but arranged to start after classes ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-interview&quot;&gt;The Interview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being nervous, and excited, but feeling confident for the interview. I mean they contacted ME. Well, they contacted the career services department, and they recommended ME. This guy. That’s right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m sitting there in a corner with imposter syndrome crawling down my back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first, real industry interview. I had practiced interviews with a couple of instructors, which really helped, but only so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was given a test before the interview, I might still have it… I’ll try to find it. I was given a design document for a trivia-quiz-like game, and I had to write up a document breaking down the time each element would take to implement. I had to break down UI and gameplay, and basically show that I was capable of taking a huge end-goal, and turning it into milestones and bite sized tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was working on the breakdown, I had the thought that I would try to actually create the game too. There was enough information there to at least get it started. So in Unity, I created the menu system, and a rough implementation of taking a quiz that had a question and 4 answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I showed this thing that I was proud of to one of my instructors and he insisted that I didn’t show it during the interview because it wasn’t polished or even close to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m in the interview showing them this thing I built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, they loved the initiative. They loved that I was able to breakdown the document and started working on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the interview I can’t really remember, but I do remember being asked this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Her: “How do you feel about your working being 80% programming, and 20% documentation?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Me: “That sounds good to me.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Her: “How about 60% programming, and 40% documentation?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Me: “I’d still be okay with that”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Her: “What about 20% programming, and 80% documentation?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Me: “I’d still do it”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, keep in mind. I was extremely hungry for this job. My first job in the game industry. I would have cleaned the toilets just to put on my resume I worked in the same building where a game was being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PING: “Supported the developers by ensuring they had clean facilities.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily it didn’t go that way, and I really was programming like 90% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recall it taking a couple of days for them to get back to me. All of which of course I was very anxious to know whether or not I got the job. Even an email saying I &lt;em&gt;DID NOT&lt;/em&gt; get the job would have made me feel better than the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">UI Programming - Unity, C# Implemented UI (menus, npc and gameplay interactions, help masks) Implemented dynamic, data-driven gameplay UI Gameplay Programming Implemented gameplay (hazard detection, question popups, scoring system, timers, level switching, rapid prototyping)</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Art Institute of Phoenix, Bachelor of Arts, Visual and Game Programming</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/resume/blog/2018/08/03/art-institute-of-phoenix-bachelor-of-arts-visual-and-game-programming.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Art Institute of Phoenix, Bachelor of Arts, Visual and Game Programming" /><published>2018-08-03T07:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-08-03T07:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/resume/blog/2018/08/03/art-institute-of-phoenix-bachelor-of-arts-visual-and-game-programming</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/resume/blog/2018/08/03/art-institute-of-phoenix-bachelor-of-arts-visual-and-game-programming.html"></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Maricopa High School</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/resume/blog/2018/08/02/maricopa-high-school.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Maricopa High School" /><published>2018-08-02T07:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-08-02T07:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/resume/blog/2018/08/02/maricopa-high-school</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/resume/blog/2018/08/02/maricopa-high-school.html"></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
