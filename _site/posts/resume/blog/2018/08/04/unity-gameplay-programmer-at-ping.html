<h3 id="initialize">Initialize</h3>
<p>One thing that stinks about a project failing, is that there is a pretty good chance you’ll have nothing to show.</p>

<p>At PING, we worked hard for 11 months, and then one day we were ushered out, never to hear about our game again.</p>

<p>PING was my first gig right out of college. In fact, I technically had the job two weeks before I graduated, but arranged to start after classes ended.</p>

<h3 id="the-interview">The Interview</h3>
<p>I remember being nervous, and excited, but feeling confident for the interview. I mean they contacted ME. Well, they contacted the career services department, and they recommended ME. This guy. That’s right.</p>

<p>So I’m sitting there in a corner with imposter syndrome crawling down my back.</p>

<p>It was my first, real industry interview. I had practiced interviews with a couple of instructors, which really helped, but only so much.</p>

<p>I was given a test before the interview, I might still have it… I’ll try to find it. I was given a design document for a trivia-quiz-like game, and I had to write up a document breaking down the time each element would take to implement. I had to break down UI and gameplay, and basically show that I was capable of taking a huge end-goal, and turning it into milestones and bite sized tasks.</p>

<p>As I was working on the breakdown, I had the thought that I would try to actually create the game too. There was enough information there to at least get it started. So in Unity, I created the menu system, and a rough implementation of taking a quiz that had a question and 4 answers.</p>

<p>I showed this thing that I was proud of to one of my instructors and he insisted that I didn’t show it during the interview because it wasn’t polished or even close to complete.</p>

<p>So I’m in the interview showing them this thing I built.</p>

<p>It turns out, they loved the initiative. They loved that I was able to breakdown the document and started working on the project.</p>

<p>The rest of the interview I can’t really remember, but I do remember being asked this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Her: “How do you feel about your working being 80% programming, and 20% documentation?”</li>
  <li>Me: “That sounds good to me.”</li>
  <li>Her: “How about 60% programming, and 40% documentation?”</li>
  <li>Me: “I’d still be okay with that”</li>
  <li>Her: “What about 20% programming, and 80% documentation?”</li>
  <li>Me: “I’d still do it”</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, keep in mind. I was extremely hungry for this job. My first job in the game industry. I would have cleaned the toilets just to put on my resume I worked in the same building where a game was being made.</p>

<ul>
  <li>PING: “Supported the developers by ensuring they had clean facilities.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Luckily it didn’t go that way, and I really was programming like 90% of the time.</p>

<p>I recall it taking a couple of days for them to get back to me. All of which of course I was very anxious to know whether or not I got the job. Even an email saying I <em>DID NOT</em> get the job would have made me feel better than the unknown.</p>
