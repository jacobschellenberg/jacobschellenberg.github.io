It's been 5 years.

Keep in mind this is totally biased, from my perspective, my own personal interactions, relative to my home, etc.

First, lets break it down into things I look for in a company:

# Rating Table

Category | Importance* | Reason
Commute | 9 | Can I walk there? Can I bike there? Can I drive there in 5, 10, 15min? 30, 45, 60min?
Company Events | 3 | Christmas party? It could be fun, but isn't necessary.
Company Size | 7 | 3, 5 people? That's a bit small. 10-30? I'll be comfortable here. 50-500, 500-10,000? I don't know if this is for me. 
Compensation | 9 | I sure do like money. Is it stable? Is it available now? Do we have to deliver an MVP first? Oh you've talked to a couple investors?
Dress Attire | 8 | Suit up? Casual fridays? Jeans on wednesdays? Flip flops and Hawaiian shirts?
Location | 9 | Heart of the city? Bobs basement? Work from home?
Management Engaged w/ Team | 8 | Open door? Center cube on the floor? On my team?
Team Building Events | 4 | Once a quarter? Once a year? Never?
Snacks | 3 | Healthy snacks? Daily donuts/bagels? Cereal bar? No snackage? 
Regular Catering | 1 | If it's free it's me.
Food Trucks | 1 | Once in a while is fine, but not necessary. Pad Thai? yes please.
Diversity | 5 | I enjoy the company of anyone willing to share it with me.
Cleanliness | 8 | Mold? No thanks. Unfiltered drinking water? Nope. Bathroom rats? No can doosville. Dust? It's Arizona, we live and breathe dust.
Political Status | 5 | Uplifting discussions only. Arguing is not a conversation.
Religious Status | 5 | I've always enjoyed a healthy conversation about anything.
Ethical/Moral Status | 10 | I'd rather not write viruses.
Tech Stack | 5 | I love learning new tech, tools, languages, etc.

Commute | 6 | 45m-1hr depending on traffic.
Company Events | 5 | Only for special occasions.
Compensation | 8 | I was quite happy with my pay.
Dress Attire | 8 | Yep, wear what you want.
Location | 6 | Shared office buildings, but overall decent location.
Management Engaged w/ Team | 4 | This one is hard. Immediate leaders were readily available, but above them- near silence, even though they could be seen and heard from their own nearby offices.
Team Building Events | 0 | Nothin'.
Snacks | 6 | Better grab em' in the morning!
Regular Catering | 6 | There was more catering than I expected, but mostly because of special occasions. Not just because it was regular.
Food Trucks | 8 | Tuesdays and Thursdays with variety. Pad Thai truck? Yes please.
Diversity | 5 | I'm going to need to better define what diversity means to me.

# TOTALS

Looking at my career with these numbers really puts things into perspective. It's surprising for me to see the tally, and actually agree with it. I feel like I did a decent job focusing on the positive aspects of each company, because c'mon it's so easy to bash and hate things. Overall, I've had an exciting career thus far with ups and downs like anyone else. I am who I am, and where I am because of these companies who were willing to bet on me.

People ask why I didn't stay in certain places very long, and this helps me to solidify those reasons. Each time I changed companies was for a, not necessarily 'better' opportunity, but better in the sense that it lined up with my career and life goals.

* From college to PING, made great sense despite the commute. It was my foot in the door.
* From PING to GCU, well- we were layed off from PING. I'm glad to have had a friend in GCU to get me in.
* From GCU to AZDPS was a failed attempt to leave the culture of GCU that I didn't quite fit into.
* If AZDPS to InkSoft wasn't a miracle, than I'ma duck.
* And from E-Line to Tivity, it was truly a difficult decision, but I'm glad I followed through.

I'm happy where I am, and will ride this wave into the sandy beach. Of course I'll have to jump back in eventually, but for now- I'm surfin'.

Company | Total Rating | Notes
PING | 70 | The commute alone was a longetivity killer.
GCU | 65 | Honestly, the culture killed me here. I just couldn't find my place, and it wears on ya.
AZDPS | 31 | Nope.
InkSoft | 119 | Looking back, it was wonderful here despite the bug fixing.
E-Line | 99 | I got to tell people I was a game developer, and that is legend-ary.

I had a great time writing up this retrospective. I've learned and grown a ton, personally and professionally. Let's do this again sometime.
