### Initialize
One thing that stinks about a project failing, is that there is a pretty good chance you'll have nothing to show.

At PING, we worked hard for 11 months, and then one day we were ushered out, never to hear about our game again.

PING was my first gig right out of college. In fact, I technically had the job two weeks before I graduated, but arranged to start after classes ended.

### The Interview
I remember being nervous, and excited, but feeling confident for the interview. I mean they contacted ME. Well, they contacted the career services department, and they recommended ME. This guy. That's right.

So I'm sitting there in a corner with imposter syndrome crawling down my back.

It was my first, real industry interview. I had practiced interviews with a couple of instructors, which really helped, but only so much.

I was given a test before the interview, I might still have it... I'll try to find it. I was given a design document for a trivia-quiz-like game, and I had to write up a document breaking down the time each element would take to implement. I had to break down UI and gameplay, and basically show that I was capable of taking a huge end-goal, and turning it into milestones and bite sized tasks.

As I was working on the breakdown, I had the thought that I would try to actually create the game too. There was enough information there to at least get it started. So in Unity, I created the menu system, and a rough implementation of taking a quiz that had a question and 4 answers. 

I showed this thing that I was proud of to one of my instructors and he insisted that I didn't show it during the interview because it wasn't polished or even close to complete.

So I'm in the interview showing them this thing I built.

It turns out, they loved the initiative. They loved that I was able to breakdown the document and started working on the project.

The rest of the interview I can't really remember, but I do remember being asked this: 
* Her: "How do you feel about your working being 80% programming, and 20% documentation?"
* Me: "That sounds good to me."
* Her: "How about 60% programming, and 40% documentation?"
* Me: "I'd still be okay with that"
* Her: "What about 20% programming, and 80% documentation?"
* Me: "I'd still do it"

Now, keep in mind. I was extremely hungry for this job. My first job in the game industry. I would have cleaned the toilets just to put on my resume I worked in the same building where a game was being made.

* PING: "Supported the developers by ensuring they had clean facilities."

Luckily it didn't go that way, and I really was programming like 90% of the time.

I recall it taking a couple of days for them to get back to me. All of which of course I was very anxious to know whether or not I got the job. Even an email saying I _DID NOT_ get the job would have made me feel better than the unknown.
